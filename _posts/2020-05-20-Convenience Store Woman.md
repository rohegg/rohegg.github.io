Ever since I was young, everyone used to say something like "Don't do this, it's not appropriate since you are a girl". Even up until now, my friends, parents, coworkers, all the folks nearby me say something like  "You should do this since you are in the late twenties".

Of course, I know there's a certain type of lifestyle among human creatures. Being born, going to school, graduation, getting a job, marriage, having kids, retirement, and raising grandkids again...

But whenever I imagine these things that I mentioned above, I wonder who decided those things and why people follow that.

Is that something always has been done from the stone age in natural? Is this related to the Characteristics of human nature?
I couldn't get any answer.

The book 'Convenience Store Woman' is also pointing out the stereotypes and social conventions through a woman's life, who has been working at Convenience Store for more than 10 years.

The main character 'Furukara' has been different from others ever since she was young. When other kids feel a sense of pity looking at a dead bird at the street, she was thinking that would be delicious for the dinner.

Because of that difference, she always has been bullied by being told "you are weired"

After graduation, she hasn't got a full-time job. She happens to start a part-time job at a Convenience store and the job was perfectly fit well with her. Also she did the well.

Therefore, she decided to stay forever as a convenience store but the problem happens starting from there. 

One day, a boy came out as a new part-timer, Shihara, who is representing the most painful aspects of this society in the novel.

He is the one who got so many hurt because of the social convention, and customs people decided but, eventually turned into a monster having ironic aspects of pretending a victim of the social convention and at the same time being a cheerleader of the custom.
