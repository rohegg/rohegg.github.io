After I joined a new company, I started reading English books. The company I joined is someplace in which hiring foreigners a lot, so speaking English is required. Not mandatory, but I thought if I could, it would be more helpful.

However, I hadn't studied English for a while after graduation, so I had to do something. Since I didn't want to get stressed from studying, so I decided to combine something I love and studying English. And It was reading books.

'Factfulness' is something chosen to read because of that. Luckily, back then, I discovered Bill Gate's blog by chance and there were a lot of book recommendations by him. 'Factfulness' was in there, Bill said this was one of the most important books he has ever read. Besides, He donated this book to libraries at all universities in the US.

When I first saw this book, I thought this book would be something related to how to read numbers or how to analyze some figures, but it was not. This book is about our instincts: stupid and distorted human instinct. The writer introduces ten instincts we have and explains why we think that ways, how much wrong we are, and how to prevent them.

He linked these instincts with understanding the world. But I think it also applies in daily life. When we see someone, when we judge some circumstances, even when we do work, the distorted instincts make us misjudge and misread.

After reading this, now I could realize how much I have been looking at the world as distorted, have had outdated information.

Since I just finished this book, maybe I could maintain the objective perspective for my self, but I'm pretty sure I would lose this lessons after time goes by. So I'd like to write some memorable parts of this book in here.
I hope this could help me to make myself as a wise, reasonable person.

> 10 instincts that we have but make us misread

1. **Gap instinct**
: Even though the majority doesn't have a significant discrepancy, people are prone to think something has a huge gap because they only look at the edge cases.
2. **Negative instinct**
: Because of outdated information and being delivered dramatic incidents by media, people think everything gets worse. (But in reality, the world is in improving.)
3. **Line instinct**
: Once people witness some increase of certain parts, people think that will continue. (But there's nothing keep growing.)
4. **Fear instinct**
: Once people feel fear of something, people tend to misread the whole thing.
5. **Size instinct**
: When we see a number, we should compare that with other numbers. A single figure can't explain everything. (Let's say, we spend 3 million tons of water for a year, then we need a comparison to figure out how much it differs from other countries.)
6. **Generalization instinct**
: When we see a group of people, we tend to consider them to have the same characteristics. (But there's no one 100% same, in detail, they all have differences.)
7. **Destiny instinct**
: People tend to believe there's something already decided and will never be changed. For instance, something like 'Hot weather countries can not make development because of the weather.' However, in reality, there is a bunch of clear evidence there's no destiny, and nothing is permanent.
8. **Single instinct**
: Even though everything is so linked and complex, people think something happens because of one single thing.
9. **Blame instinct**
: When something gets wrong, we have a tendency to blame one person. But according to the writer, we don't need to blame someone because, in actual, the impact that one person could make is very small.
10. **Urgency instinct**
: When there's an incident, people easily think that is the only chance. But this kind of perspective makes us make the wrong decision.
