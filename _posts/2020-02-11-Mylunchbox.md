My digestion has not been good since I was young. Meat, especially red meat, always has made me uncomfortable. Something made by wheat flour was the same.

After I moved to Seoul for the university, It got worse. At that time, I was not good at cook so I couldn't eat well-made food for a while.
I'd say I've tried to eat well, but I was lack of money and time both. Cooking is something that requires time, money, heart, and soul.

After I got a job, it seemed to be better, but not much changed. As I started to eat outside more often, it might be more nutritious, but that habit always made me eat much, and a lot of chemical seasonings were there. I wouldn't say I liked that, but I've spent those kinds of days for about four years.

The problem happened to start last September. I can't remember why, but at that period, I had a bunch of personal appointments at dinner, I used to overeat. Often I overdrunk as well. It was a trigger.

I couldn't get sleep because I was too full. I couldn't digest what I ate a day till midnight. I drunk liquid digestive medicine almost every night, ate pills as well. It was suffering, it continued for about two weeks.

After that experience, I determined to minimize eating out. Although it will take a lot of time and money, I decided to eat more something I make. I'm not sure that it would be tastier, but I wanted to avoid overeating and unhealthy ingredients. That is why I started to make my lunch-box.

I was not sure how much time it will take, so at first, I just got up one and half hour early. But I thought there might be some hacks to make preparing work shorten, so I started to explore YouTube. YouTube always has the answers. 👍

I've referred to Japanese ladies' videos. Also, the 'Tasty' and 'Beak's' channel helped me a lot.

After a couple of back and forth, I became able to make my own rules. Now the preparation time gets halved, and I can manage my morning schedule.

I divided one hour by 15 minutes. Two quarters are allocated for lunch-box, one quarter is allocated for Yoga minutes.
(There's a YouTube channel called 'Yoga Boy,' offering 15 minutes Yoga videos for every morning. I decided to watch that channel during my Yoga minutes.)

It's been only one week, but I've been keeping this routine so far. And I'll continue this till at the end of Jan. (When the end of January comes, I'd like to check what kind of changes happen. If there's something I need to adjust, I should do.)

Someone could ask me, why do you start your day with so many things. But I believe morning is the only time of a day that nobody can interrupt.
And If this small change could make my life healthier and more vibrant, I'm willing to invest it.
