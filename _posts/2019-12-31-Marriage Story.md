> Memorable scenes

- C : I get stuck in my way and she knows when to push me and when to leave me alone. She is always inexplicably brewing a cup of tea that she doesn't drink.
- N : He loves being a dad. He loves all the things you're supposed to hate, like the tantrums, the waking up at night.

00:12:12

- N : You don't think it's bad, do you?
- C : I don't ever watch TV, so you know, I can't tell

01:04:05

- C : Did you dye your hair again? Is that for your show?
- N : No, this is me. It was this way when I saw you before.
- C : I know, but I didn't say anything then.
- N :  You don't like it?
- C : No, I guess it's fine. Is it shorter? I prefer longer but..

01:34:39

- C : Come on, you were happy. You've just decided you weren't now. 
You wish you hadn't married me, you wish you'd had a different live, but this is what happened.
- C : You'll never be happy, in LA and anywhere. You'll think you found some better opposite guy than me and in a few years, you'll revel against him, because you need to have your voice, but you don't want a voice. You just want to complain about not having voice.

02:06:14

- C : I wanted to tell you I took a residency at UCLA. I'm going to direct two plays in rep at REDCAT.
- N : oh..
- C : So, I'm going to be here for a while.
- N : That's great.
- C : Are you okay?
- N : Yeah, it's only good.
